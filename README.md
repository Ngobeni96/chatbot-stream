# 🎓 Career Guidance Chatbot

A simple AI-based Streamlit web app that helps users discover suitable career options based on their **interests**, **skills**, and **favorite school subjects**.

🌐 **Live App**: [Click to try it!](https://chatbot-st-coztuw6jswyny8uupbrdks.streamlit.app/)

## 🧠 How It Works

Users enter short responses to three questions:
- 🔍 Interests (e.g., technology, creativity, helping others)
- 🛠️ Skills (e.g., coding, leadership, communication)
- 📚 Favorite subjects (e.g., math, art, economics)

The app uses simple **if-else logic** to match keywords and suggest a set of career options accordingly.
